## WRO FUTURE ENGINEERS 2025 - TEAM Bismillah-Motors




## Introduction

We are a self-driving vehicle prototype for the WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition, which will be a fully modular, automated, capable of making decisions based on computer vision. Currently we are working on the hardware layout and adapting the code for some sensors we are testing and benchmarking for distance, depth and overall sense of position for the vehicle's main controller, and there will be multiple sensors assigned to one task to maximize the accuracy of measurements.
